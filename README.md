# Sheffield Eco Motorsports Control Team Repository

This version abstracts the code by creating a header file in which the relevant control functions are located. The main file then includes said header file. This makes the code clearer to read and helps debugging and/or improving it.

Code developed by Sheffield Eco Motorsport Controls Team.
